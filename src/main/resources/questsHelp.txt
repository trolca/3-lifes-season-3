In the main data folder of this plugin you can find 3 folders and as you can imagine they are for storing custom quests that you can make
You have the daily folder where you put all of the daily quests you want
You have the weekly folder where you put all of the weekly quests you want
You have the card folder where you put all of the card quests you want

You have to create a .yml file with the specified attributes:
task-name - the name of the task (String)
description - description of the task (ArrayList<String>)
database-name - the name of the table that will be created in the mySQL database (String)
icon - the item that is gonna be the icon of that task (Material)
max-progress - because every progress if stored with an int you specify the number to finish this task (int)
listener-type - listener type which is from TaskListenerType remember all caps (You have the list of types below)
target - its an object which is converted to a specific target you need to do to finish any given task (for example if you had KILL_MOBS listener type you would need to type the entity itd)
        (You can put a list of targets if you want to for example if you have KILL_MOBS listener you could put:
        - ZOMBIE
        - SKELETON, for the quest to check if a player kills zombies or skeletons.)

if there is no target then the quest is gonna work on everything (in the listener type)
ex. if I put a quest with listener-type of BREAK_BLOCKS but I'll put no target then every block the player breaks will count towards this quest
